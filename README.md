# Name-Image-Likeness
This repository is intended to create a platform for student-athletes to monetize the use of their name, image, and likeness during college athletic careers. The way I envision student-athletes navigating a new world of monetization is made of two parts: 
1) The first is a growing social media presence by increasing fanbase and followers - this is something that will naturally occur as the student-athlete is provided opportunities to be on the collegiate level stage. Social Media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube will be vital tools for athletes to leverage in their journey. 
2) The next is best described as a student-athelete e-commerce marketplace (now referred to as SA-NIL) - There are at least three parties that will be involved in every transaction on SA-NIL: 1) Buyer (i.e., fan, follower, etc.), 2) Seller (i.e., student-athlete), 3) Merchandise Manufacturer/Supplier (Example: Nike, UnderArmour, etc.). 

**Benefits to the Buyer:** One stop shop for all athletic merchandise for all favorite athletes.
**Benefits to Seller:** Single, simplified platform to monetize the use of their name, image, and likeness. 
**Benefits to the Manufacturer/Supplier:** Additional source of demand to move product lines.

My thoughts on the design of this platform:
1) Sellers will be required to build a profile on SA-NIL - this is where they will fulfill buyer orders, track historical transactions (product, revenue, etc.)
2) Buyers will need to be able to search and filter by:
    - Athlete name
    - University 
    - Sport
    - Product 
3) A workflow needs to be designed in order to fulfill orders from Merchandise Manufacturer to Seller to Buyer.
